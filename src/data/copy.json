Scientists call this “brain plasticity.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first period of brain plasticity is from ages 0 to 3, when our brains [grow rapidly](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK234146/). We create new billions of brain cells and neural connections.  But this second period of plasticity, between 11 and 14, is when our neural connections are reorganized, writes developmental psychologist Laurence Steinberg in his book \"[Age of Opportunity.](https://www.laurencesteinberg.com/books/age-of-opportunity)\" \r\n\r\n\r\n**>> Timeline: 0 to 3 + 11 to 14**\r\n\r\n\r\nThe brain reorganization happens because our brains become highly sensitive to what we experience, both good and bad.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne experience that is [especially heightened](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature25770) is <strong>social interactions</strong>. Steinberg writes that, during this period, we are more sensitive to social acceptance and rejection.

Industrialization and immigration brought a huge influx of families to urban areas, crowding K-8 schools, according to a [RAND book](https://www.rand.org/pubs/monographs/MG139.html) on middle schools.

They wanted smaller group learning, better relationships with teachers, and more exploration. They called it middle school.\r\n\r\n\r\nSlowly, more and more districts adopted the middle school model.\r\n\r\n\r\n**>> Chart | [NCES](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d10/tables/dt10_097.asp)**"},{"attribute":"id","grades":"5,6,7","start":"5","text":"After middle school, things stay pretty much the same as they transition to high school."},{"attribute":"School Engagement","grades":"8,9,10","start":"8","text":"In high school, <label>school engagement</label> falls even further."},{"attribute":"School Teacher-Student Relationships","grades":"8,9,10","start":"8","text":"Very few students have strong <label>relationships with teachers</label>."},{"attribute":"School Belonging","grades":"8,9,10","start":"8","text":"And their <label>sense of belonging</label> stays low."},{"attribute":"School Belonging","grades":"8,9,10","start":"8","addclass":"bigText","text":"So, should we get rid of middle schools?\r\n\r\n\r\nResearch out of [New York](https://www.educationnext.org/stuck-in-the-middle/), [Florida](https://www.educationnext.org/the-middle-school-plunge/), and [several other](https://ies.ed.gov/ncee/edlabs/regions/west/Ask/Details/53) areas found that kids who attend middle schools learned less, while feeling lower levels of belonging and self esteem, when compared to kids who attend K-8 schools.
