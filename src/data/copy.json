We create new billions of brain cells and neural connections.

Everything from candy to sex to punk music just *feels* better, while bad things like rejection or bullying feels worse.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne thing that will feel [especially good](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature25770) is social interaction and acceptance.
