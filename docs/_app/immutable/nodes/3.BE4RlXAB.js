But this second period of plasticity, often between ages 11 and 14, is when our neural connections are reorganized.<sup>1</sup>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIMAGE|timeline\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe brain reorganization happens because your brains become highly sensitive to what we experience, both good and bad.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOne experience that is [especially heightened](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature25770) is <strong>social interactions</strong>. During this period, we are more sensitive to social acceptance and rejection. So hanging out with friends *feels* better than it does at other points in our lives, while being rejected or bullied feels worse. These experiences rewire our brains; some neural connections get stronger, while others are cut off.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIMAGE|braindiagram\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile, your brains will also develop a greater capacity for [self-direction](https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/25388/the-promise-of-adolescence-realizing-opportunity-for-all-youth).

Most school districts had one school for kindergarten to 8th grade. But those schools were getting overcrowded, especially in cities.<sup>1</sup> That’s because people moved to cities because that’s where there were new jobs for adults, and immigrants also came from other countries and moved to cities. Meanwhile, everyone from [college presidents](https://www.tojned.net/journals/tojned/articles/v04i01/v04i01-01.pdf) to the [National Education Association](https://www.rand.org/pubs/monographs/MG139.html) argued that seventh and eighth graders should attend a school that prepares them for high school, rather than going to K-8 schools with young kids. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSo the solution for districts was to open “junior high schools.” \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIMAGE|middleschooltimeline\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBut junior high was [basically](https://archive.org/details/educatingyoungad0000unse_q0p1/page/36/mode/2up?q=Mounting+Dissatisfaction) high school for younger kids, so in the 1960s [people who studied education](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/19404476.2016.1165036) wanted to replace junior highs with something that actually considers what people your age need—things like smaller group learning, better relationships with teachers, and more exploration. They called it middle school.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSlowly, more and more districts adopted the middle school model.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIMAGE|middlevjunior\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBut in a lot districts, middle school was just another name for junior high. And education experts started to worry that, maybe, middle schools still weren’t working. So researchers decided to compare how middle-school kids are doing versus kids who still attend K-8 schools. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nStudies [across](https://www.gse.harvard.edu/ideas/ed-magazine/12/09/do-middle-schools-make-sense) the [country](https://ies.ed.gov/ncee/edlabs/regions/west/Ask/Details/53) found that kids who attend middle schools learn less, while feeling lower levels of belonging and self esteem, when compared to kids who attend K-8 schools. An important [2010 study](https://www.educationnext.org/stuck-in-the-middle) of New York City students found kids struggled a lot when they transitioned to middle school, compared to kids who stayed in K-8 schools.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIMAGE|research\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, yeah, transitioning to middle school really does suck!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBut in the chart above, notice how fifth-graders in K-5 schools actually do *better* than fifth-graders in K-8 schools. Researchers wondered whether being the oldest kid in a school—the “[top dogs](https://journals.sagepub.com/stoken/rbtfl/5rYuHMOFCG3nc/full)”—actually helps students, while going to school with older kids hurts them. A [few](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0094119018300081) [studies](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/498996) actually found that the benefits of being a top-dog in a K-5 elementary school actually makes up for the amount of learning you’ll lose in middle school.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSo if we got rid of middle school, that might actually make fourth- and fifth-grades not as great as you remember.
