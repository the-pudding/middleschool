Your brains will become more malleable—that means they’ll be like a block of clay softening up so they can be resculpted. Scientists call this “brain plasticity.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first period of brain plasticity is from ages 0 to 3, when our brains [grow rapidly](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK234146/). We create new billions of brain cells and neural connections. But this second period of plasticity, between 11 and 14, is when our neural connections are reorganized.&lt;sup>1&lt;/sup>\r\n\r\n\r\n**>> Timeline: 0 to 3 + 11 to 14**\r\n\r\n\r\nThe brain reorganization happens because your brains become highly sensitive to what we experience, both good and bad.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne experience that is [especially heightened](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature25770) is &lt;strong>social interactions&lt;/strong>. During this period, we are more sensitive to social acceptance and rejection. So hanging out with friends *feels* better than it does at other points in our lives, while being rejected or bullied feels worse. These experiences rewire our brains; some neural connections get stronger, while others are cut off.\r\n\r\n\r\n**>> Diagram**\r\n\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, your brains will also develop a greater capacity for [self-direction](https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/25388/the-promise-of-adolescence-realizing-opportunity-for-all-youth).

People moved to cities because that’s where there were new jobs for adults, and immigrants also came from other countries and moved to cities. So K-8 schools were super crowded.1 So taking the older kids out of elementary school and putting them in junior high made practical sense.
